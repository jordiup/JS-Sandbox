# Error Handling

## Try-catch
A try block allows us to do some code, while the catch block allows us to catch the errors, rather than ending the program abruptly; a more elegant solution.

## Regex
Used to describe a pattern of matching, and pulling strings or useful information from a body of characters.

## Metacharacter Symbols
Different symbols which can be used in regex patterns.
