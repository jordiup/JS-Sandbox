# ES2015+ Misc Notes

## Iterators and Generators
Both different but used in similar ways; to iterate through things. You can call part of a return, pause it then call the next part and so on. Iterators are like advanced loops which can be paused, Generators are functions that can be paused.

## Destructuring
Introduced in ES6, gives us an easy way to assign variables and extract variables from arrays and frameworks. Any kind of modularised JS will use this such as Reaact.
