Asynchronous programming describes the asynchronous loading of

AJAX and the fetch API are used for making http requests to files API's and services. AJAX, XML and the HTTP request object are quite old, but reliable. Fetch is a new standard - we will work with both.

Async technologies:
 - xmlhttprequest & fetch
 - jQuery Ajax, Axios, other HTTP libraries
 - Node.js (filesystem) module

 Async code can be achieved by working with callbacks, promises, or async/await.

- It does not interfere with the current page
